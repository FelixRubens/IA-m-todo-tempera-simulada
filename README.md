# Simulated annealing - AI

AI device implemented to solve the 8 piece puzzle


The test functions in the main function are generated 100 inputs, possible states start for the solve code.

About How Heuristics

Heuristic 1 takes as a parameter the number of pieces that are in the wrong places before making a decision on the next step.

Heuristic 2 takes into account the sum of the distances of the pieces in the wrong places and their respective correct places.


Remember: that the algorithm with this method always leads to the best possible result, a local maximum, and does not guarantee a solution.
